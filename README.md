# CoolingTablesCalculateRate
Stand-alone C program that reads in the CoolingTables from Ploeckinger & Schaye (in prep.), 
interpolates in 4 dimensions,and returns the total net cooling rate for arbitrary abundance 
ratios, redshifts, densities and temperatures

Individual routines can be directly used and / or adapted to couple to different hydro-dynamic codes.
